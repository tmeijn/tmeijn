## Background

## About me

- I was born in Amsterdam, but my parents moved to Almere at my ripe age of one and lived there ever since.
- I have two cats, Poki and Bubbles. They are brothers.
- I enjoy reading since I got an E-reader, playing guitar, working on (most time fixing...) my BMW Z3, running and going to the gym.
- I love playing games! Some favorites are Red Dead Redemption, Ghost Recon Wildlands and Breakpoint in Co-Op, and of course the Witcher 3.

## Preferred Working Style

- I prefer to work Remote and I am a huge Advocate for working Remote and asynchronous. At the same time I also like to meet face-to-face occasionally, to build the relationship non-work related.
- I do my best work in the early morning and late afternoon.
- I tend to set Pomodoro timers (1 hour) where I close Slack and Teams to focus on the task at hand.
- When I get sucked into a specific thing, I might stay up all night and sleep the next day. I'll let you know when this happens, so I don't miss anything important.
- I can make morning meetings, but I prefer meetings in the afternoon for the above reasons.
- I'm pretty strict about my working hours and will not make exceptions very lightly. I want to be 100% with my family and I need strict hours for that.

## Communication style

- English is not my native language and I only have a pretty good mastery of it, but it could definitely be improved. Sometimes I may search for the correct word that I'm translating from Dutch to English. Please be patient with me when that happens.
- I ask questions. I am not afraid of not knowing things, and I will seek for help whenever necessary. If it feels like I am questioning you it is because I am either:
  - trying to gather context or,
  - trying to understand if everyone is on the same page.
- Based on the above: I tend to prefer a lot of context so I can make the best decision possible. That can lead to me asking questions that may be obvious to you. Know that I'm just trying to gather context.

## What I like to learn

- ALL THE THINGS!
- How to implement Continuous Deployment in a big Organization.
- How to create a single pane for our Observability capabilities.

### Feedback

- I love getting feedback as that is one of the major ways to grow. For me, it might not feel comfortable at the given moment, but I'm always trying to take your feedback seriously and incorporate it into my potential growth.
- I enjoy receiving public praise, but private praise fuels me.
- I value stability and predictability - I hate feeling uncomfortable. Sometimes I can react negatively to change but I do my best to embrace it and keep a positive mindset. I recognize that growing means feeling uncomfortable.

## Availability

- My timezone is [CET/CEST](https://time.is/CET).
- I generally work from ~08:00 to ~18:00 from Monday to Thursday.
- I'm pretty strict with my cut-off time and will go into my shutdown routine at around ~17:30, but I can always make exceptions.

I like to start my day fresh with running and training at home and then starting around ~08:00 fresh and motivated.

During this time...

- You will see my calendar blocked with a Busy event whenever I take personal time during the day.
- If you see a good time on my calendar inside my working hours, please schedule something (no need to ask first). You can do so either via Google Calendar (preferred).
- TODO: setup my Calendly page.
- If you need to reschedule something, go ahead! All my calendar events are set with modify privileges and you should feel free to go ahead and move it to some other time slot that is within business hours and not conflicting with other meetings.

How to reach me...

- **Phone:** I rather not to be contacted on text message/WhatsApp. I might not actively be on Slack so feel free to call me when it is urgent.
- **Slack:** DM or mention is the best way to reach me during the day.
- **Email:** I read my emails multiple times a day but I will default to my weekly plan for priorities. You should not feel obligated to read or respond to any messages you receive from me outside of your normal hours.
- **GitLab & GitHub:** Please @ me directly in comments in GitLab/GitHub so I see your message, and assign MRs to me.
